            What is Lorem Ipsum?<br>
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing <br>
and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's <br>
standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer<br>
 took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br> 
 It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>
 typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <br>
 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>
 and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus <br>
 PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>
 <br>
Why do we use it?<br>
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by <br>
the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point <br>
of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution <br>
of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', <br>
making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing <br>
packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default<br> 
model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web <br>
sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the <br>
years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour <br>
and the like).<br>
<br>
<br>
Where does it come from?<br>
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random <br>
text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from <br>
45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin <br>
professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the <br>
more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, <br>
and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, <br>
discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections <br>
1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The <br>
Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This <br>
book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during <br>
the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum <br>
dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.<br>
<br>
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is <br>
reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and <br>
1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are <br>
also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied<br> 
by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.<br>
<br>
Where can I get some?<br>
There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, <br>
but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by <br>
injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even <br>
slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of <br>
Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything <br>
embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem <br>
Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined <br>
chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator <br>
on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words,<br> 
combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate <br>
Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum <br>
is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or <br>
non-characteristic words etc.<br>
